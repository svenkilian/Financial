# Financial Time Series Forecasting

This code repository pertains to the seminar project titled "*Using Machine Learning for Empirical Asset Pricing*", 
supervised by *Patrick Jaquart* at the chair of *Information & Market Engineering* at KIT.

The project aims at predicting the excess returns for a defined asset universe by means of advanced machine learning 
methods such as **LSTM Networks** and **Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees** and devising trading strategies to capitalize 
on uncovered opportunities for arbitrage.
