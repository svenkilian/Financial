Project
-------
This code repository pertains to the seminar project titled "**Using Machine Learning for Empirical Asset Pricing**",
supervised by *Patrick Jaquart* at the chair of *Information & Market Engineering* at KIT (winter semester 2019/20).

The project aims to predict the excess returns for a defined asset universe by means of advanced machine learning
methods such as **LSTM Networks** and **Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees** and to devise derived trading strategies
to capitalize on opportunities for arbitrage.

This work extends the previous work by [KRAUSS2018]_ and [KRAUSS2017]_.
